Notes:
The game starts with you in fourth place.
The console will display a timer. 
You cannot go until the timer is done counting down for start. 
There are three laps.
If you start to run off the course, your speed will be reduced and you will be pushed back on course.
There are three computer controlled cars on course.
If you hit one of these cars from the rear or near the rear, your speed will be reduced.
If you hit one of these cars and you are closer to the lead than it is, they will have the speed reduced.
Have fun.
